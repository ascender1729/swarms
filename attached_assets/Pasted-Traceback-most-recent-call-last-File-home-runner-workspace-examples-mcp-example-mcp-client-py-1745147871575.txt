IndentationError: unexpected indent
`IndentationError: unexpected indent` means Python found a line that is indented farther than the block it lives in.  
In `agent.py` the culprit is inside **`add_response_filter`** (around line 1870).  
Just move the `logger.info(…)` line two spaces to the **left** (so it lines up with the first statement in the function) and, while you’re there, fix the small typo in the attribute name.

```python
# ── swarms/structs/agent.py ─────────────────────────────
    # Response Filtering
    def add_response_filter(self, filter_word: str) -> None:
        """
        Add a response filter to filter out certain words from the response.
        """
        logger.info(f"Adding response filter: {filter_word}")
        # attribute is self.response_filters (an "s"), not self.reponse_filters
        self.response_filters.append(filter_word)
```

Full diff‑style patch  (*only the three changed lines shown*):
```diff
@@
-        logger.info(f"Adding response filter: {filter_word}")
-        self.reponse_filters.append(filter_word)
+        logger.info(f"Adding response filter: {filter_word}")
+        self.response_filters.append(filter_word)
```

After you save the file:

```bash
black swarms/structs/agent.py     # optional but keeps everything well‑indented
python -m py_compile swarms/structs/agent.py
```

Compilation should pass and the `mcp_client.py` script will start without the indentation error.
