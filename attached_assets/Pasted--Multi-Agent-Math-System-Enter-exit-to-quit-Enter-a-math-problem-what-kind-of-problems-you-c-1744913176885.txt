Calculate fifteen percentage of hundred╭────────────────────── Agent Name Calculator [Max Loops: 1 ] ──────────────────────╮
│ Calculator: To calculate fifteen percent of one hundred, you can use              │
│ multiplication and division.                                                      │
│                                                                                   │
│ First, convert the percentage to a decimal:                                       │
│                                                                                   │
│ 15% = 15 / 100 = 0.15                                                             │

│ Now, multiply this decimal by 100:                                                │
│                                                                                   │
│ 0.15 * 100 = 15                                                                   │
