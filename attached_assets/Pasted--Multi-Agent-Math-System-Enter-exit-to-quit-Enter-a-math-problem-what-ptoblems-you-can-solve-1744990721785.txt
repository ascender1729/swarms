I can perform basic mathematical operations: addition (use '+' or 'plus'), multiplication (use '*' or 'times'), and division (use '/' or 'divide by'). For example: '5 plus 3' or '10 divide by 2'
I can analyze stock data using moving averages and calculate percentage changes. For example: 'calculate moving average of [10,20,30,40,50] over 3 periods'
