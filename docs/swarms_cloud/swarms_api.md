# Swarms API Documentation

*Enterprise-grade Agent Swarm Management API*

**Base URL**: `https://api.swarms.world` or `https://swarms-api-285321057562.us-east1.run.app`
**API Key Management**: [https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys)  

## Overview

The Swarms API provides a robust, scalable infrastructure for deploying and managing intelligent agent swarms in the cloud. This enterprise-grade API enables organizations to create, execute, and orchestrate sophisticated AI agent workflows without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Key capabilities include:

- **Intelligent Swarm Management**: Create and execute swarms of specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks
- **Automatic Agent Generation**: Dynamically create optimized agents based on task requirements
- **Multiple Swarm Architectures**: Choose from various swarm patterns to match your specific workflow needs
- **Scheduled Execution**: Set up automated, scheduled swarm executions
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Track and analyze all API interactions
- **Cost Management**: Predictable, transparent pricing with optimized resource utilization
- **Enterprise Security**: Full API key authentication and management

Swarms API is designed for production use cases requiring sophisticated AI orchestration, with applications in finance, healthcare, legal, research, and other domains where complex reasoning and multi-agent collaboration are needed.

## Authentication

All API requests require a valid API key, which must be included in the header of each request:

```
x-api-key: your_api_key_here
```

API keys can be obtained and managed at [https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys).

## Error Handling

The Swarms API follows standard HTTP status codes for error responses:

| Status Code | Meaning | Handling Strategy |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Validate request parameters before sending |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check API key validity |
| 403 | Forbidden | Verify API key permissions |
| 404 | Not Found | Check endpoint URL and resource IDs |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Implement exponential backoff retry logic |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Retry with backoff, then contact support |

Error responses include a detailed message explaining the issue:

```json
{
  "detail": "Failed to create swarm: Invalid swarm_type specified"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API enforces a rate limit of 100 requests per 60-second window. When exceeded, a 429 status code is returned. Implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff in production applications.

## Billing & Cost Management

The API uses a credit-based billing system with costs calculated based on:

1. **Agent Count**: Base cost per agent


2. **Input Tokens**: Cost based on the size of input data and prompts

3. **Output Tokens**: Cost based on the length of generated responses

4. **Time of Day**: Reduced rates during nighttime hours (8 PM to 6 AM PT)

Cost information is included in each response's metadata for transparency and forecasting.

## Best Practices

1. **Task Description**

   - Provide detailed, specific task descriptions

   - Include all necessary context and constraints
   
   - Structure complex inputs for easier processing

2. **Agent Configuration**
   
   - For simple tasks, use `AutoSwarmBuilder` to automatically generate optimal agents
   
   - For complex or specialized tasks, manually define agents with specific expertise
   
   - Use appropriate `swarm_type` for your workflow pattern

3. **Production Implementation**

  - Implement robust error handling and retries
  
  - Log API responses for debugging and auditing
  
  - Monitor costs closely during development and testing
  
  - Use scheduled jobs for recurring tasks instead of continuous polling

4. **Cost Optimization**

  - Batch related tasks when possible

  - Schedule non-urgent tasks during discount hours

  - Carefully scope task descriptions to reduce token usage

  - Cache results when appropriate

## Service Tiers

The API offers two service tiers to accommodate different processing needs:

### Standard Tier

- Default processing tier

- Immediate execution

- Higher priority processing

- Standard pricing

- 5-minute timeout limit

### Flex Tier

- Lower cost processing

- Automatic retries (up to 3 attempts)

- Longer timeout (15 minutes)

- 75% discount on token costs

- Best for non-urgent tasks

- Exponential backoff on resource contention

To use the flex tier, set `service_tier: "flex"` in your SwarmSpec configuration.
